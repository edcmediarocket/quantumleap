## Style Guidelines:

- The primary color will be a vibrant purple (#A020F0), providing a sense of futuristic innovation without feeling too somber or corporate. This reflects the AI-driven and elite focus of the app.
- The background color is a very dark, desaturated purple (#1A141F) to support the dark theme and neon accents.
- For interactive elements, use an accent color that is an analogous blue (#20A0F0) to draw the userâ€™s eye, ensuring visibility and ease of use in key actions.
- Clean, sans-serif fonts will ensure legibility and readability for all users.
- Implement glassmorphism UI on cards to create a frosted glass effect.
- Subtle hover animations on cards (scale, shadow, glow) add interactivity.
